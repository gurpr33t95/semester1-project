					<h3> VW Golf GTi</h3><p> is a recognisable 147 is a sleek, sporty looking hatchback that has all the Italian flair of its predecessors as well as an improved drive quality and excellent engines. Voted car of the year in 2001, it was a formidable competitor to the likes of Audi and BMW. It’s one of the best looking Alfas around, and still has the ability to turn heads. In terms of driving, it has a fair amount of understeer but that’s what makes it fun to drive; you feel a lot more involved. The interior is certainly an improvement on previous Alfas. It’s nicely designed and really comfortable. There’s plenty of room and a decent amount of leg room. It comes with a good sized boot, although it isn’t the biggest in class.
